# Code-Refactor

# Description
The **Code-Refactor-Assignment-Week-One** project is the first homework assignment of the March 2021 cohort from University of New Hampshire's full-stack coding bootcamp. 

Based on a real-world situation, we were given existing code and asked to refactor it based on our client's needs. This project was centered around accessibility, and was required to meet a certain set of client standards and grading requirements.

The ficticious guest was a marketing agency, and I reworked the code to make it more efficient and organized to make the structure of the HTML more semantic.

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
