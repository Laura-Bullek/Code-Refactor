# Code-Refactor-Assignment-Week-One-

# Description
The **Code-Refactor-Assignment-Week-One** project is the first homework assignment of the November 2020 cohort from University of New Hampshire's full-stack coding bootcamp. 

Based on a real-world situation, we were given existing code and asked to refactor it based on our client's needs. This project was centered around accessibility, and was required to meet a certain set of client standards and grading requirements.

The ficticious guest was a marketing agency, and I reworked the code to make it more efficient and organized to make the structure of the HTML more semantic.
